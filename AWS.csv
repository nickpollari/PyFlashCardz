KMS,What are the two types of encryption with CMKs?,1. Symmetric<br>2. Asymmetric
KMS,"When you create a CMK in KMS, by default you get what kind of CMK encryption?",Symmetric
KMS,What is a Symmetric CMK?,"Same key is used for encrypt and decrypt, based on AES 256. The data never leaves AWS unencrypted and you must call KMS API to use it"
KMS,What is an Asymmetric CMK?,This is a mathematically related Public/Private key pair based on RSA and ECC. The Private key never leaves AWS unencrypted and you must call the KMS API to use the Private key. The Public key can be downloaded and used outside AWS. AWS Services that are integrated with KMS do not support asymmetric CMKs
